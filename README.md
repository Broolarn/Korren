Many students live in corridor accommodation or in collectives.These often uses
some sort of schedule and or a list of tasks that some or each person has to doe
each week. The goal for this project is to create a website/portal that allows 
several users to create/connect to a room and add tasks/chores as in 
trello/hacknplan. There will preferably be some sort of rolling schedule and 
if there is time a chat related to the group would be good/fun. 

The technical components of this project is made through JavaScript and the 
components include:
Database: Mongodb
Backend: nodejs ->Express
Frontend: Angular
